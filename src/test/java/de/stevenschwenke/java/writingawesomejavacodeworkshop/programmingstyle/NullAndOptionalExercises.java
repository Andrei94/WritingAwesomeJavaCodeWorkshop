        Have a look at the code you brought with you to this workshop.

        1. Do a fulltext search and find out how many not-null-checks your codebase has.

        2. Pick one of those checks. If you can use Java 8 Optional, apply it to your code. If you
           cannot use Java 8, write a custom Null Object or use Guava:
