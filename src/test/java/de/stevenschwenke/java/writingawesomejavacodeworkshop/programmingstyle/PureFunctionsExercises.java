    /*

        Have a look at the code you brought with you to this workshop.

        1. Do you find a pure function already in there? Try to find out why it was written as a
           pure function. Why aren't other methods in your code base a pure function, too?

        2. Pick a method from your codebase. Try to refactor it to one or more pure functions.
           Hint: Because pure functions are smaller than regular functions, it's likely that you'll
                 extract more than one pure function.
