    /*
        Have a look at the code you brought with you to this workshop. Spot at least one of the
        following:

        1. Code that can be refactored to a fluent API (maybe even a DSL) to make the usage more
           readable, more intuitive and less error-prone.

        2. Code that could be refactored to a fluent API or DSL but shouldn't because it would
           obscure the meaning or readability of your code.

        3. Begin to refactor your code to have a fluent API.

        Hint: The creation and filling of data classes can often be written with fluent API.
